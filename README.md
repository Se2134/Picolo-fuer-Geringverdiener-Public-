Picolo f√ºr Geringverdiener is a simple copy of the drinking game "Picolo". It was started in September 2023 as a present for a friend. 
This public version is a cleaner version without insiders and names, but with placeholders at places where they used to be.

At this point Picolo is the only implemented game, but the app build with the idea in mind to add other games as well. 
The present also contains a "Drehplatte", which made another playing mode possible as well, that just added different questions to the existing ones. 

Due to the start in 2023 most of the variable names are German and it could be expanded in complexity by adding parts such as saving the name list for the next time.
